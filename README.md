# Advanced Redux Example

This is an example of a Redux setup with normalized handling of entities. The mean goal is to show an appraoch to handling data coming from a REST API in combination with relations and pagination. This repo is heavily inspired by the Redux [real world example](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/tree/master/examples/real-world). 

## Setup

First run the server: `json-server --port 4000 --delay 1000 db.json`

After that start the frontend: `yarn start`
